  	      @dunmao_ @JeanLaurensLab If I may push my luck &amp; ask a few more Qs...<br><br>1. Have you looked at reward correlates?<br><br>2. Have you looked at the stability of the different tunings, within and across sessions?<br><br>3. Was the food distributed truly randomly, or in places that had not been recently visited?
