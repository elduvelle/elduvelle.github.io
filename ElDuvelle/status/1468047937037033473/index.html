  	      The whole "you are expected to finish your past work even if you're not paid for it" is still very prevalent in academia but, spoiler alert: it is not normal, it is not how it should be, it is BAD and plans should be made to never have to rely on that.<br>(Yes, I hate it) <a href="https://twitter.com/AcademicFemale/status/1467824212983300096">https://twitter.com/AcademicFemale/status/1467824212983300096</a>

  	      My advice to all PhD students out there: *plan* so that you'll finish your papers while paid for it. <br>No, the paper will never be perfect. <br>No, it doesn't really need this control.<br>No, your PI will not "figure something out" (that's just you working for free). <br>Just. Finish. It.
