  	      @MariRSosa @PubPeer 1. We were not looking for reward coding cells but goal cells, which is why our task dissociates the location of a spatial goal and that of reward.  2. We found extra-field firing at the spatial goals which is a form of goal coding. 3. The task is anything but simple. 2/x

  	      @MariRSosa @PubPeer For example, they say that a continuous T-maze task (Lee et al., 2006) is “more complex” than our task, although we have 2 uncued spatial goals, with different values: our rats have to locate the goals &amp; decide which is the most valuable, not just alternate in a linear track. 3/x

  	      @MariRSosa @PubPeer They also claim that their task is “more complex” than our task although rats learned their task in less than 10 min while they learn ours in several weeks. Also, our rats have to pause at the correct loc and wait for reward, not just reach a dispenser. 4/x

  	      @MariRSosa @PubPeer There are many other problems in that paper, for example in the “complex” category they include a linear track task in VR, in the “no reward coding by PCs category” they include a *striatum* paper that found reward coding (🤷), etc. 5/x
