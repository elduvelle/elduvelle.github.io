  	      @neuralreckoning I'm pretty sure thay the existence of "postdocs" was just created because of lack of funding for permanent positions, not because it's a step needed to become a "good PI"<br>in France we still have cases of ppl moving on to permanent just after PhD.. but it's becoming rarer.
