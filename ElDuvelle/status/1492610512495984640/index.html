  	      @BeetzJerome The reason why place cells and head direction cells in rats are so convincing is that their existence was demonstrated in conditions with homogenous sampling &amp; behaviour, and with many controls, cue rotations, in the dark etc. The water maze task is not designed for that (at all)
