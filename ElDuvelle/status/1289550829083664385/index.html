  	      Suddenly, a businessman arrives and i) picks on our favourite neuroscientist (üòò), just making a sort of joke, and ii) says he‚Äôll do the same as what we‚Äôve supposedly been doing for years as if it was a major leap forward. This triggers massive excitement from non-scientists 2/5

  	      Isn‚Äôt it understandable that this combinaison of things will create frustration? Sure, it‚Äôs not good to react like we did but we are also humans. We wish we could so easily provoke excitement about science in others, or have large means at our disposal to improve technology. 3/5

  	      Also, this seems like, after spending years on improving the technique and knowledge up to a point where it‚Äôs now good enough (using mostly public &amp; non-profit funding), the industry seizes it for their profit, without seemingly a trace of gratitude to scientists. 4/5

  	      So, I agree with @TrackingActions‚Äì we shouldn‚Äôt pick on non-scientists, it is partly our fault that we don't communicate on our work (but, money, time?). I also understand why the community reacted like it did and I wish E. Musk was more appreciative of scientists' work. (end)
