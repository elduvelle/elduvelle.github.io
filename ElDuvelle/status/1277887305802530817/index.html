  	      @J_KoenigGambini @nehathemartian @ReadMoreScience Of course it's just 1 example and I also know people who got hired (mostly in startups) with a PhD. Related to my original point, I think it's better to do a PhD aiming for industry than academia, because you know you are likely to reach your goal in the 1st case, not in the 2nd.
