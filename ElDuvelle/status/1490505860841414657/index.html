  <title>4 bis. I also noticed that only activity during selected 'ballistic runs' was analyzed, but some of the splitter activity can be observed while waiting in the start box - did you notice anything splitter-like there?</title>

  	      After reading the paper I have a few questions/comments for @nitz_douglas, hope it's OK!üôè<br>1. Love the task! Also looks painful to runüòÖ <br>I wondered what happened during each 5-trials block: is there a start delay, does rat stay on maze? &amp; between blocks: is rat taken out, where?

  	      2. How was the order of maze locations chosen? Were they gradually moving from one end of the room to another, or was it 100% randomized? Also - just curious - how did you move the maze, was it on tracks or something?

  	      3. So place cells (not even a subset?) do not remap between different positions of the maze - interesting!<br>Could this the same as the 'place field repetition' usually observed in environments of similar geometry - since the maze has the same geometry for all locations?

  	      4. It is very interesting that you don't seem to find splitter cells. I wondered how this was analyzed given that there is only 1 correct response per maze location, and you did not analyze the error trials (right?)? Comparing L-turn from some locations to R-turn from others?
