## HOW-TO Make the same one for you:

### 1. Download your twitter archive  
From the [twitter website](https://twitter.com/), ooo > your account > Download an archive of your data > go through the verification steps > Request data > Come back to download it when you're notified that it's ready (it might take a few days)
  
### 2. Create a [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) Website  
_In more details:_  
- Create a new public repository on [Github](https://github.com/) named username.github.io ('username' is your github username) > Create Repository  
- Clone the repository (e.g. if you use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), on the main page of your new repo: Code > Open with Github Desktop > (in Github Desktop) Clone Repository)  
- (optional) to check that the website creation worked, you can create an 'index' file in the repository, following instruction 3 on the Github Pages doc)
      
### 3. Convert your archive with [Darius' tool](https://tinysubversions.com/twitter-archive/make-your-own/)  
_In more details:_
   - Enter your new website address (https://username.github.io/)  
   - Navigate to your downloaded twitter archive in Darius' website  
   - Click on 'Make my archive'  
   - Wait for all the steps to run  
   - A new 'archive.zip' file will be downloaded to your computer  

### 4. Upload the archive to the website  
- Open your new Github repository folder (created in 2) on your computer (if using Github Desktop: Click on Show in Explorer)  
- Move the archive.zip file there  
- Extract the archive in that folder, it might take a while, you will then see a bunch of files (app.js, index.html, styles.css etc.) and a folder (YourUsername/)  
- Commit to Github (in GitHub Desktop: write a commit message, then Push). This might take some time too.  

### 5. Open your website!
Wait a little bit for the Github Pages to work its magic (or on the repository website, go to the Action tab > pages built and deployment > rerun all jobs)  
Go to **https://username.github.io/** and admire your work!
